weight remarks and ratings by support - improved std a lot (use ratio for remarks)
change default values
combine ratings and remarks
use log(date) for weighting or decaying exp
use one-hot for comps (do it properly - n-1 labels) - improved mean but reduced std
vary hyper parameters of GBC
add extra feature unique to a companys
do augmentation
print all params once and check
Check all columns of all files for weird data values
Consider remark_date when using it
read PS once
I used the wrong ratings for supp_ratings
